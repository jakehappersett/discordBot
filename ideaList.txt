##how to make bot##
1. using the example (https://github.com/sleibrock/discord-bots/blob/master/bots/Bot.py) combinde the bot.py and the dumbbot.py (custom ofc) and get it working

2. could also keep those seperate, but for practice rewrite code (look shit up when you run across stuff you dont know)

3. create simple working bot using python best practice 
    - maybe one method to start
